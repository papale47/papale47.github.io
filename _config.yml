Thanks for visiting my porftolio! My name is Jason Papale, and I am currently a Lead Decision Science Analyst at USAA. 
Since my transition out of the military in 2018, I have continued to work to improve my level of knowledge and proficiency in the field of data science. 
In this portfolio, I have included some of the more substantial projects I have worked on as part of that journey, most of which I completed as part of 
the UC Berkeley Master of Information and Data Science (MIDS) program I recently completed. Outside of the MIDS-related projects, however, I have also included
a project which mirrors some of the attrition modeling work I have been a part of at USAA, 
as well as my captone project from the MBA I completed at Mississippi State University in 2015.

Of note, most of the code I have included with my projects will open in Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab. Outside of the attrition modeling project, however,=
these notebooks are not intended to be run in Colab (some of them aren't even written in Python). Colab, in my opinion, just makes for an easier viewing experience 
with the Table of Content functionality.
