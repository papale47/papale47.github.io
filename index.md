### Attrition Modeling Project
[Jupyter Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WpCJY0jThIiQxfWPF62ycwbyh8s5P2vU?usp=sharing) <br>
This project utilizes a customer churn dataset I obtained on Kaggle and entails building two binary classifier models to predict churn. The notebook linked above is broken into four main sections: 
<br>
1.  Exploratory data analysis (which includes dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques) and data transformations  <br>
2.  The development and evaluation of two classification models which includes the use of Bayesian Optimization to find more optimal hyperparameters <br>
3.  An economic framework which aids in translating model performance into expected business impact, as well as in identifying the optimal classification threshold <br>
4.  A simulated experiment which quantifies the impact of a model-driven treatment 
<br>
My initial motivation for creating this notebook was to consolidate many of the
