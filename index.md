### Attrition Modeling Project
[Jupyter Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WpCJY0jThIiQxfWPF62ycwbyh8s5P2vU?usp=sharing) <br>
This project utilizes a customer churn dataset I obtained on Kaggle and entails building two binary classifier models to predict churn. The project also includes:
<br>
1.  Exploratory data analysis (which includes dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques) and data transformations  <br>
2.  Hyperparameter tuning using Bayesian Optimization and a custom net economic value function as a metric to score model performance <br>
3.  An economic framework (illustrated below in the image) which aids in translating model performance into expected business impact, as well as in identifying the optimal classification threshold <br>
4.  A simulated experiment which quantifies the impact of a model-driven treatment 

My initial motivation for creating this notebook was to create an end-to-end modeling project using open source data that would allow me to consolidate smaller but related bodies of work I have pursued (in both academic and professional settings) in one place. I was also interested in having a platform (i.e., Google Colab) on which I could use an open source dataset to explore and become more proficience in data science techniques I haven't worked with yet. Another motivation for writing this notebook is to serve as a guide for others who are interested in learning more about modeling, experimentation, or translating model performance to business impact. Finally, I do intend to continually supplement and improve upon (particularly in terms of additional documentation and in-line comments) this notebook over time, so if there are any suggestions or errors which you idnetify, please let me know!
